# Development Steps

## [2026-04-01] Initial Synthesizer Implementation

### Goal
Implement a basic MIDI-driven synthesizer with a sine wave engine and rodio output.

### Approach
1.  **MIDI Input:** Created a `midi` module to parse raw MIDI bytes into high-level `NoteOn` and `NoteOff` events using `midir`.
2.  **DSP Engine:**
    *   Implemented a `SineOscillator` for waveform generation.
    *   Created a `Voice` struct to manage individual note state and frequency calculation.
    *   Implemented a `SynthEngine` to manage polyphony (voice assignment and mixing).
3.  **Audio Output:** Implemented the `rodio::Source` trait for `SynthSource` to bridge the `SynthEngine` with the hardware.
4.  **Communication:** Used `crossbeam-channel` for thread-safe communication between the MIDI callback thread and the audio playback thread.

### Key Decisions
*   **Decoupling:** Separated MIDI parsing, DSP logic, and audio output into distinct modules (`midi`, `dsp`, `engine`, `output`).
*   **Polyphony:** Used a simple polyphonic voice management system (up to 8 voices) to allow multiple notes to be played simultaneously.
*   **Sample Rate:** Fixed the sample rate to 44.1kHz for consistent audio generation.

### Verification Steps
*   Ran `cargo check` to ensure code compiles and follows Rust safety rules.
*   The system is ready for manual testing with a MIDI controller.
